      My name is Garrett Stanger and I'm currently living in Rexburg Idaho
      going to school on campus. I served my mission in the Hawaii Honolulu
      Mission from 2015-17. I'm a senior in the Software Engineering
      department and have loved my major so far.

      I love both the summer and the winter. I love going on hikes and camping
      and playing sports when its warm outside. I hate being inside when its a
      nice day outside. On the contrary, I really love being inside during the
      winter and peacefully watching people from warm places suffer in the
      cold outside. I'm not married right now but hopefully that will be
      changing soon!

      I've had a couple of really good opportunities for work in the last
      couple years. For about the last 4 years, I worked in the IT department
      for BYU-Idaho managing the replacement projects for all of the
      technology for campus. I recently left that job and started working HVAC
      for a private contractor to work way better with my class schedule.
